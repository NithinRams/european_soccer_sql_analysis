## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a **3-layer approach to SQL problem-solving**:

1️⃣ **Clarify the Goal** – Determine exactly what output is needed.
2️⃣ **Identify Relationships** – Decide aggregation level and comparison strategy.
3️⃣ **Build Step-by-Step** – Start with basic queries, then add metrics, groupings, and filters gradually.

> This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in writing complex SQL queries.
