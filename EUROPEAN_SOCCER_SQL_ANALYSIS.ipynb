goal (what do I need to output?)\n\nExample:\n\n“Find the highest scoring match per country per season.”\n→ I need country_id, season, and the match with the most goals.\n\nThat tells you your columns and granularity (the level you’re grouping at).\n\n2️⃣ Identify relationships (what level do I aggregate?)\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nDo I need totals per group → use GROUP BY.\n\nDo I need to compare each row to a group → use subquery or CTE + JOIN.\n\nDo I need to pick the top record per group → use MAX() with GROUP BY or window functions.\n\nThis step builds the structure of your solution.\n\n3️⃣ Build step-by-step (don’t jump straight to final query)\n\nStart small:\n\nWrite a query that gets the basic data.\n\nThen compute the metric (like total goals).\n\nThen group or filter it.\n\nThen, if needed, join it back or filter by max.\n\nThink of it like solving a puzzle one piece at a time — not writing the perfect query from the start.\n\n🧠 Example: Applying this thinking\n\nProblem: Find teams that scored above their season’s average.\n\n1️⃣ Output? → team_id, season, goals.\n2️⃣ Relationship? → comparing each team to the season average → needs subquery or CTE.\n3️⃣ Steps:\n\nFirst get AVG(goals) per season.\n\nThen join it to main table.\n\nThen filter where team_goals > avg_goals.\n\nYou’ll notice you’re now thinking like SQL, not just memorizing patterns.\n\n*/\n\n/*
